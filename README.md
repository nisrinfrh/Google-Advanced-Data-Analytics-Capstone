Background: 

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

Project goal:  

Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.


Scenario: 

You are the newest member of Waze’s data team. Your team is about to begin their user churn project. The first step is to create a project proposal. The proposal will clearly define the overall goal of the project, and identify key tasks, milestones, and stakeholders.
